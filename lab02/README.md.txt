1. App is the component
2. userName is a prop, Name is one state element
3. JSX uses curly braces to distinguish it from strings, interprets it as JavaScript
4. I have none, but these are functions with no identifier, can't be accessed because it doesn't have an identifier to identify it by
5. The app doesn't use HTML, but it does use CSS, stylesheets, to style
