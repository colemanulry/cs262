Project Ideas: 
1. The Calvin soccer stadium has no outdoor concession stand... The crowd must walk to the field house in order to order their food/hot chocolate. This app would allow the crowd to preorder beverages and food to be ready for them by the time they get inside at halftime, so that they don't have to wait in lines or wait for their food and miss the game. 

2. Our soccer coach uses an old-fashioned white board in order to demonstrate game strategy. This app would be user-friendly for our coach to use his finger, with his screen projected onto the TV screen, to move around virtual players and opponents.
